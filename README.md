# Electronics Repair Service Store Management System

## Description
The Electronics Repair Service Store Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of an electronic repair shop. It allows clients to submit repair requests, and the shop owner (admin) can assign these requests to staff members who will then visit the client's location to perform the repairs. The system provides an efficient way to manage repair tasks, track progress, enhance communication between clients and staff, and facilitate on-site repairs.
